  <!-- I want to create an immersive, interactive website for my AI video. This video constructs a stream-of-consciousness space about reality, nothingness, and existentialism through poetic language and dream-like images. Therefore, I hope that the webpage is not only a display carrier, but also the entrance for the audience to enter this journey.
      The main user interaction behaviors I chose are: (Scroll) and (Hover).
      These two operations have the characteristics of "touch" and "fading", which can well convey the sense of "subconscious flow" in my video.
      I hope that users will not browse a webpage, but "roam" in a consciousness space, and gradually discover the content through small actions such as scrolling and hovering, rather than obtaining information all at once.

       I conceived the entire website as a five-chapter page structure:
       Navigation bar, Introduction, Timeline of video content analysis, Gallery, and video playback area. -->

  <body>
    <!-- Navigation bar: It can clearly indicate the website structure. Each navigation button will have a halo diffusion or text micro-vibration effect when the mouse hovers over it. It creates a stream of consciousness and a sense of fantasy. You can jump to different areas when you click. For example: when you click Gallery, you will jump to Gallery, and the area below the Gallery button on the navigation bar will light up to show your location. -->

    <nav>
      <a href="#intro" class="nav-link active">Introduction</a>
      <a href="#timeline" class="nav-link">Timeline</a>
      <a href="#gallery" class="nav-link">Gallery</a>
      <a href="#video" class="nav-link">Video</a>
    </nav>
    <!-- Introduction: This is a transition area for the entire video. When I move the mouse to different areas, different production information and other supplementary content pop up to increase the sense of exploration. 
         Hovering over different words will trigger a pop-up effect of text or images. -->

            <p>
              They said reality was cast in iron, yet all I could ever touch -
              was mist. They handed me an iron mask, calling it a gift for
              growing up. I practiced the arc of my smile, again and again,
              until calluses bloomed on my cheeks, fitting the mask perfectly.
              Look the cracks had begun back then. Pain, the very first miracle.
              When my blood seeped into the cracks, nothingness finally gained
              its weight.

            <h3>The Elephant’s Revelation</h3>
            <p>
              In those years, deep into the night, I often heard heavy footsteps
              approaching from afar. Until one day, I realized - it was only my
              own heartbeat, hauling the weight of the entire world inside my
              hollow chest. How laughable - that we tear each other apart, all
              for the applause that never truly existed. How absurd - that we
              dance with shackles on our feet, and call it measuring the
              boundaries of freedom. So why not Escape completely, from our
              rotting shells, from the insoluble riddles of life?

            <p>
              They told me: "Grasp the light, and you shall become light." Yet
              the light slipped through my fingers, leaving behind a deeper
              shadow. We are all transparent vessels, holding the fleeting
              moment, leaking the eternal. Someday, we will understand: Regret
              is that the moonlight cannot illuminate certain corners. And life
              - needs such shadows to define the shape of light.

              Now I understand: the elephant never truly left. We simply grew
              used to lowering our heads. So why not learn to love the gaps
              where the wind slips through? It is through them that the eternal
              wind passes through our fleeting bodies.

<!--
The current design emphasizes immersive interaction and real-time feedback, such as the title words triggering image or color changes after hovering, horizontal drag-and-drop galleries, etc. 
These elements work well on the page and provide reusable interaction mode templates for a wider range of projects.
Focusing on the interaction method of visual feedback and user-initiated exploration, it provides a "poetic navigation experience" that is different from traditional web pages. 
This experience can be extended to many fields such as exhibition introductions, official websites of independent artists, and experimental video works, providing users with a deeper perception path.
But the overall interface feels not creative enough, and the interactive effect seems to be somewhat repetitive and monotonous. 
In addition to watching videos and reading content, users should not browse repeatedly many times. When exploring my interactive website, users should spend the most time reading. How to increase derivative content or fun will be a big challenge.

Future expansion:

Add AI-generated voice as hover feedback;

Add more animation interaction effects;

The background color can also be changed to gradient or automatic change to enhance the sense of dream flow. -->
