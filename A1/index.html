          <p>
             The first thing I noticed was the background text on the page, which
             is the visual center focus. The color adopts the design principle of
             "Contrast", and the oversized title "Luniverse" with white gradient
             attract my attention with an excellent visual hierarchy. "Welcome
             to Luni's universe" conveys the core value and content of the
             website.

        <p>
            I spent the most time on the different interactive models and animated mini-games. The visual design and fun are very attractive, and each interface has many different interactive triggers that make me want to explore further. The second is the "Discover" interface on each interface. This part is a more detailed introduction to Luni, with a lot of text and a longer reading time.

        The most common operations are scrolling and clicking. The interface is rich, and clicking can trigger different experiences of the interactive device. I hope to experience every creative and ingenious design of the designer.

  </div>
  <div class="back">
    <p>
       
    </p> The interfaces of the web design are: Home, Omada, Studio, Career, Luni life. The main goal of the website seems to be to showcase multiple aspects of Luni, including its projects, the capabilities of the studio, recruitment information, and company culture to attract potential clients, collaborators, or job seekers.It records the process and experience of the team's life and work. It also provides job seekers with more information, concepts, and channels, which is a way to attract talents through clear calls to action and intuitive navigation.

      (6) How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="back">
    <p>
      The website guides users to explore different aspects of Luni through a clear navigation structure. The design style is simple and the information hierarchy is clear, so users can quickly find what they need. The website design enhances the page's attractiveness through clear visual hierarchy, high-contrast icon design (oversized titles and slogans), high-quality design style, animation effects, and highly interactive and interesting 3D models. It attracts users to continue exploring and guides users to take the next step.

        The experience appears to be designed for short, repeated interactions. Users might spend a few minutes exploring the site for the first time and return periodically to check for updates or new features.

  <div class="back">
    <p>
        The website references modern digital design trends, with a minimalist style and an emphasis on visual storytelling, in line with contemporary web design aesthetics. References include video games (interactive game model) and social media platforms (LinkX, Linkedin, and Discord).

      (10) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="back">
    <p>
        Through intuitive navigation and visual cues, you can naturally explore various parts of the website without too much text guidance. The overall visual style should be unified, and interesting interactive elements should be added to increase the stickiness of the website to users. Update content and create a community to increase the interaction rate.

        In addition to the content, the design of the website should have a good visual effect. The website's fun, innovation and interactivity can keep users interested while browsing the website and increase the length and frequency of users' use of the website.

    <p>
        The content of the website is relatively simple. The scrolling effect when switching interfaces is not smooth, which can easily make people lose interest.

    <p>
        I think I like the visual effect the most. It looks simple and elegant. It combines modernity with technology, 2D with 3D. Hierarchy, Contrast, and Element layouts have a lot of visual layers. The colors are rich, bright, and harmonious, and the text is clear and concise.
