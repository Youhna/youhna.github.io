        <h3>The Weight in Disguise</h3>
        <p>They said reality was cast in iron, yet all I could ever touch - was mist.
          They handed me an iron mask, calling it a gift for growing up.
          I practiced the arc of my smile, again and again, until calluses bloomed on my cheeks, fitting the mask perfectly.
          Look
          the cracks had begun back then.
          Pain, the very first miracle.
          When my blood seeped into the cracks, nothingness finally gained its weight.</p>

        <h2>Scene 2</h2>
        <h3>The Elephant’s Revelation</h3>
        <p>In those years, deep into the night, I often heard heavy footsteps approaching from afar.
Until one day, I realized -
it was only my own heartbeat,
hauling the weight of the entire world
inside my hollow chest.
How laughable -
that we tear each other apart, all for the applause that never truly existed.
How absurd -
that we dance with shackles on our feet, and call it
measuring the boundaries of freedom.
So why not
Escape completely, from our rotting shells,
from the insoluble riddles of life?</p>

        <h2>Scene 3</h2>
        <h3>The Testimony of Light</h3>
        <p>They told me: "Grasp the light, and you shall become light."
          Yet the light slipped through my fingers, leaving behind a deeper shadow.
          We are all transparent vessels, holding the fleeting moment, leaking the eternal.
          Someday, we will understand:
          Regret is that the moonlight cannot illuminate certain corners.
          And life - needs such shadows
          to define the shape of light.</p>

        <h2>Scene 4</h2>
        <h3>Forgetfulness and Return</h3>
        <p>Now I understand:
          the elephant never truly left.
          We simply grew used to lowering our heads.
          Better then
          to love the gaps where the wind slips through.
          For it is through those cracks that the eternal wind passes through our transient bodies.</p>
